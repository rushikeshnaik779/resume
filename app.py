### FIle Monitoring :  
 - Automated the file monitoring task with the help of Python script. In this project we developed a script which runs on the scheduled time and detects new files that arrived and the files that are yet to arrive & according to which it creates alerts using SMTP protocol where SME gets the email alert.

- Application Data update Request : Automated the process of updating User and Customer details in App with the help of powershell script. We developed a script which takes the input in GUI of powershell(poshGUI) and updates the user and customer details in MS SQL Database and provide alert after updation or failure. 

- Automation Selenium:Test automation, where we had to do an end to end testing.i.e. from the link to report generation. 
    - Purpose: test the module‚Äôs visibility & loading time. It saved almost 2 hours of the SME daily.  
### Power BI:
- Worked on various datasets to visualise the data. Untill now I have delivered  more than 15 dashboards, where I faced different challenges, according to the specific domain. Automated most of the dashboards, that eliminated complete manual intervention.

## Personal Projects : 
- Salary Prediction : To predict the salary of employee based on the information provided in the dataset. It helped company as well as employees to get benefit and optimise.

- Car Price Prediction : Developed and deployed the model using flask.It was a regression problem and in that problem my main focus was to understand Linear Regression with help of dataset present on kaggle. Initial steps were data preprocessing, feature engineering & dealing with missing values & after that I used various models. 

- Sentiment Analysis ;  Covid sentiment detection with help of RNN and LSTM. Developed a model which got 85% F1 score.( Present in GitHub)   

- ChatBot: Chatbot from scratch:Developed a prototype which can understand the need of humans and get the details or provide the details with proper intent. 

- Stock price prediction with tweets: Currently I am working on it.
